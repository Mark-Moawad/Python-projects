# Python-projects
This Repo is created to demonstrate Python projects done by me or I find interesting enough to clone and give a try myself.
The projects will vary in size and complexity, and will include basic programs, games, web-based apps, Machine Learning and Data Science projects.
It is supposed to give a good insight on my capabilities in Python coding and OOP programming in general.
